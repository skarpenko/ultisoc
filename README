    The UltiSoC Project (https://github.com/skarpenko/ultisoc)


UltiSoC is a simple System on Chip design based on Ultiparc microcontroller.
Despite its simplicity it is capable to run different embedded operating systems
and applications.


PREREQUISITES

  Here is the list of prerequisites required to play with UltiSoC:

  * FPGA design software. For example, Altera Quartus or Xilinx Vivado. It is
    required for synthesizing UltiSoC for FPGA. Check corresponding websites for
    recent versions.

  * GNU C/C++ for MIPS-I ISA (http://gcc.gnu.org/). GNU C/C++ cross-compiler
    is required for building BootROM and software for UltiSoC.

  Optional:

  * Icarus Verilog v10.0 (http://iverilog.icarus.com/). Verilog simulation
    tool which is used for running RTL simulation of UltiSoC and its components.

  * GTK Wave (http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/). GTK+ based wave viewer
    which could be used for waveforms visualization.

  * Verilator v3.874 (https://www.veripool.org/projects/verilator/). Verilator
    converts synthesizable Verilog code into C++ or SystemC code. It is required
    for building cycle accurate UltiSoC system model.


DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

  /
  |- boot       - system boot ROM.
  |- fpga       - FPGA synthesis scripts and components.
  |- hw         - hardware components of SoC.
  -- setenv.sh  - environment configuration script.


SUPPORTED FPGA BOARDS

  * Terasic DE0-Nano-SoC Kit/Atlas-SoC Kit (http://de0-nano-soc.terasic.com/)


QUICK START GUIDE

  Before start make sure Quartus and MIPS-I GNU C/C++ toolchain installed
  properly and added to PATH environment variable. To check run:

      $ which mipsisa32-elf-gcc
      $ which quartus_sh

  these commands should point to the place where tools were installed.

  Clone UltiSoC repository:

      $ git clone https://github.com/skarpenko/ultisoc.git

  Prepare submodules:

      $ cd ultisoc
      $ git submodule init
      $ git submodule update

  Setup environment by sourcing setenv.sh shell script:

      $ source setenv.sh

  Run FPGA synthesis for Atlas-SoC development kit:

      $ cd fpga/atlas-soc
      $ make

  Once synthesis finished connect and power on the board. Program generated
  ultisoc.sof image to the board:

      $ make prog

  Refer to fpga/atlas-soc/doc/ directory for more details.
