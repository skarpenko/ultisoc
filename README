    The UltiSoC Project (https://github.com/skarpenko/ultisoc)


UltiSoC is a simple System-on-Chip design based on Ultiparc microcontroller.
However it is capable to run different embedded operating systems and
applications.


PREREQUISITES

  Here is the list of prerequisites required to play with UltiSoC:

  * FPGA design software. For example Altera Quartus or Xilinx Vivado. It is
    required for synthesizing UltiSoC for FPGA.

  * GNU C/C++ for MIPS-I ISA (http://gcc.gnu.org/). GNU C/C++ cross-compiler
    is required for building BootROM and software for UltiSoC.

  Optional:

  * Icarus Verilog v10.0 (http://iverilog.icarus.com/). Verilog simulation
    tool which is used for running RTL simulation of UltiSoC and its components.

  * GTK Wave (http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/). GTK+ based wave viewer
    which could be used for waveforms visualization.

  * Verilator v3.874 (https://www.veripool.org/projects/verilator/). Verilator
    converts synthesizable Verilog code into C++ or SystemC code. It is required
    for building cycle accurate UltiSoC system model.


SUPPORTED FPGA BOARD

  * Terasic DE0-Nano-SoC Kit/Atlas-SoC Kit (http://de0-nano-soc.terasic.com/)
