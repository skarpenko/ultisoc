CONNECTING SERIAL CABLE
-----------------------

In current UltiSoC design serial TxD and RxD lines are routed to GPIO1 pins:

    TxD - GPIO1 Pin  8 (GPIO1[7])
    RxD - GPIO1 Pin 10 (GPIO1[9])
    GND - GPIO1 Pin 12

CTS and RTS lines are not used.

Any serial cable which supports 3.3V logic levels can be used for enabling
UltiSoC serial console. For example, Adafruit USB to TTL Serial Cable.

Adafruit USB to TTL Serial Cable has the following leads:

    BLACK  - GND
    RED    - Power 5V (NEVER CONNECT THIS!)
    WHITE  - TxD
    GREEN  - RxD

Connecting to Atlas-SoC:

    WHITE ---> GPIO1 Pin  8
    GREEN ---> GPIO1 Pin 10
    BLACK ---> GPIO1 Pin 12
